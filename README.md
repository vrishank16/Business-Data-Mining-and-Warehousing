A retail chain, "AussieRetailers," operates across multiple states in Australia, tracking sales transactions, maintaining customer profiles, monitoring product inventory, scheduling staff shifts, and recording customer complaints. This data is stored in separate tables within a MySQL database.

### Tables Overview

### Objective

Analyze "AussieRetailers'" operational data using advanced SQL queries, focusing on sales performance, customer satisfaction, and staff efficiency. The analysis should culminate in a detailed report with insights, trends, and recommendations.
